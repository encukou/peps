Python Enhancement Proposals
============================

The PEPs in this repo are published automatically on the web at
http://www.python.org/dev/peps/.  To learn more about the purpose of
PEPs and how to go about writing a PEP, please start reading at PEP 1
(pep-0001.txt in this repo).  Note that PEP 0, the index PEP, is now
automatically generated, and not committed to the repo.


reStructuredText for PEPs
=========================

Original PEP source may be written using two standard formats, a
mildly idiomatic plaintext format and the reStructuredText format
(also, technically plaintext).  These two formats are described in
PEP 9 and PEP 12 respectively.  The pep2html.py processing and
installation script knows how to produce the HTML for either PEP
format.

For processing reStructuredText format PEPs, you need the docutils
package, which is available from PyPI (http://pypi.python.org).
If you have pip, "pip install docutils" should install it.

Abstract

    This document describes the post-Python 2.1 development and
    release schedule.  The schedule primarily concerns itself with
    PEP-sized items.  Small bug fixes and changes will occur up until
    the first beta release.

    NOTE: the schedule below and the list of features under
    consideration are all subject to change!  If the energy in the
    community changes or the feedback on a PEP is particularly
    positive or negative, this may affect decisions.


Release Schedule

    Tentative future release dates.  Note that we've slipped this
    compared to the schedule posted around the release of 2.2a1.

    19-Dec-2001: 2.2   (final release)
    12-Dec-2001: 2.2c1 (release candidate)
    14-Nov-2001: 2.2b2
    10-Oct-2001: 2.2b1
    19-Sep-2001: 2.2a3 (new! a third alpha)
    22-Aug-2001: 2.2a2
    18-Jul-2001: 2.2a1


Release Manager

    Barry Warsaw will take over as the release manager.  Guido and
    Barry will release 2.2a2 together, after that Barry will be
    responsible for releases.


Release Mechanics

    We'd like to experiment with a new mechanism for releases: a week
    before every alpha, beta or other release, we'll fork off a branch
    which will become the release; changes to the branch will have to
    be approved before they can be checked in.  This is how some other
    large projects (e.g. Mozilla) work, and we hope it will help
    reduce the number of bugs introduced in releases at the last
    minute.


Planned features for 2.2

    The following features are already checked in on the head revision
    (for a more detailed account, see Misc/NEWS):

    - iterators (PEP 234)
    - generators (PEP 255)
    - division (PEP 238)
    - unification of types and classes (PEP 252, PEP 253)

    Work on the class/type unification is still ongoing.

    The following features are under consideration:

    - unifying long ints and plain ints (PEP 237)

    There needs to be more discussion of each of these before we can
    decide.

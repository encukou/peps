Abstract

    This PEP discusses new modules and extended functionality for
    Python's HTTP support.  Notably, the addition of authenticated
    requests, proxy support, authenticated proxy usage, and WebDAV [1]
    capabilities.


Rationale

    Python has been quite popular as a result of its "batteries
    included" positioning.  One of the most heavily used protocols,
    HTTP, has been included with Python for years (httplib).  However,
    this support has not kept up with the full needs and requirements
    of many HTTP-based applications and systems.  In addition, new
    protocols based on HTTP, such as WebDAV and XML-RPC, are becoming
    useful and are seeing increasing usage.  Supplying this
    functionality meets Python's "batteries included" role and also
    keeps Python at the leading edge of new technologies.

    While authentication and proxy support are two very notable
    features missing from Python's core HTTP processing, they are
    minimally handled as part of Python's URL handling (urllib and
    urllib2).  However, applications that need fine-grained or
    sophisticated HTTP handling cannot make use of the features while
    they reside in urllib.  Refactoring these features into a location
    where they can be directly associated with an HTTP connection will
    improve their utility for both urllib and for sophisticated
    applications.

    The motivation for this PEP was from several people requesting
    these features directly, and from a number of feature requests on
    SourceForge.  Since the exact form of the modules to be provided
    and the classes/architecture used could be subject to debate, this
    PEP was created to provide a focal point for those discussions.

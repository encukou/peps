Abstract

    At present, setting the PYTHONPATH environment variable is the
    only method for defining additional Python module search
    directories.

    This PEP introduces the '-P' valued option to the python command
    as an alternative to PYTHONPATH.


Rationale

    On Unix:

        python -P $SOMEVALUE

    will be equivalent to

        env PYTHONPATH=$SOMEVALUE python

    On Windows 2K:

        python -P %SOMEVALUE%

    will (almost) be equivalent to

        set __PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH% && set PYTHONPATH=%SOMEVALUE%\
            && python && set PYTHONPATH=%__PYTHONPATH%
        

Other Information

    This option is equivalent to the 'java -classpath' option.


When to use this option

    This option is intended to ease and make more robust the use of
    Python in test or build scripts, for instance.


Reference Implementation

    See patch.

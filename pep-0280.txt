Abstract

    This PEP attempts to summarize various approaches for avoiding the
    dictionary lookup for accessing globals and built-ins in most
    cases.  There are several competing approaches, which originated
    in historical order by authors Montanaro, Hylton, and Van Rossum.
    The fourth author is added for his valuable feedback during all
    stages.

    The expectation is that eventually one approach will be picked and
    implemented; possibly multiple approaches will be prototyped
    first.


Montanaro's approach: tracking globals

Hylton's approach: using a dlict

Van Rossum's approach: using a celldict

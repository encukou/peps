Abstract

    This document describes the post-Python 2.2 development and
    release schedule.  The schedule primarily concerns itself with
    PEP-sized items.  Small bug fixes and changes will occur up until
    the first beta release.

    NOTE: the schedule below and the list of features under
    consideration are all subject to change!  If the energy in the
    community changes or the feedback on a PEP is particularly
    positive or negative, this may affect decisions.

    Here are a few PEPs that I know to be under consideration.  If a
    PEP isn't on this list, it's because I'm not a confident channeler.

    PEP 267  Optimized Access to Module Namespaces        Hylton
    PEP 269  Pgen Module for Python                       Riehl

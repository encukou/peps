Abstract

    This document describes the development and release schedule for
    Python 2.3.  The schedule primarily concerns itself with PEP-sized
    items.  Small features may be added until the first beta release.
    Bugs may be fixed until the final release.

    There is currently no defined schedule.  We hope to do the final
    release before the end of 2002, but if important projects below
    are delayed, even that may be delayed.

    There will be at least two alpha releases, two beta releases, and
    one release candidate.  Alpha and beta releases will be spaced at
    least 4 weeks apart (except if an emergency release must be made
    to correct a blunder in the previous release; then the blunder
    release does not count).  Release candidates will be spaced at
    least one week apart (excepting again blunder corrections).

Planned features for 2.3

    Here are a few PEPs and other ideas under consideration, with
    comments in "parade of the PEPs" style.  Not all of these will be
    part of the final 2.3 release; we'll update the list as decisions
    crystallize.  (There's also a bunch of things already implemented,
    like bool, PyMalloc, and universal newlines.)

    This is pretty much an unordered laundry list.  Please send
    feedback to python-dev@python.org; I hope to maintain this for the
    life of the 2.3 development process.

    - PEP 266  Optimizing Global Variable/Attribute Access  Montanaro
      PEP 267  Optimized Access to Module Namespaces        Hylton
      PEP 280  Optimizing access to globals                 van Rossum

      These are basically three friendly competing proposals.  Jeremy
      has made a little progress with a new compiler, but it's going
      slow and the compiler is only the first step.  Maybe we'll be
      able to refactor the compiler in this release.  I'm tempted to
      say we won't hold our breath.  In the mean time, Oren Tirosh has
      a much simpler idea that may give a serious boost to the
      performance of accessing globals and built-ins, by optimizing
      and inlining the dict access:

    - PEP 269  Pgen Module for Python                       Riehl

      I haven't heard from Jon Riehl, so I consider dropping this idea.

    - PEP 273  Import Modules from Zip Archives             Ahlstrom

      This project has been dormant too long.  Somebody wake it up!
      http://www.python.org/sf/492105

    - PEP 282  A Logging System                             Mick

      Vinay Sajip's implementation is close to completion IMO.  I
      expect that his code will be incorporated in the near future.
      http://www.python.org/sf/578494

    - PEP 263  Defining Python Source Code Encodings

      Implemented (at least phase 1, which is all that's planned for
      2.3).

    - PEP 218  Adding a Built-In Set Object Type

      I think it would be good to revive this in some form, using a
      module rather than a built-in type.  Alex Martelli has
      contributed a new version: http://www.python.org/sf/580995

    - A new command line option parser.  Greg Ward's Optik
      (http://optik.sf.net) would fit the bill fine; there's only some
      question about whether it should be given a less "cutesy" name.
      See also http://www.python.org/sigs/getopt-sig/

    - Provide alternatives for common uses of the types module;
      Skip Montanaro has posted a proto-PEP for this idea:
      http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2002-May/024346.html
      Unfortunately there hasn't been much progress on this.

    - Extended slice notation for all built-in sequences.  Completed:
      patch by Michael Hudson is now all checked in.

    - An iterator tools module featuring goodies from SML and Haskell?
      http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2002-May/024418.html

    - Speed up list iterations by filling tp_iter and other tweaks?
      http://www.python.org/sf/560736  (This is done; also for xrange
      and tuple objects.)

    - Deprecate the buffer object.
      http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2002-July/026388.html
      http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2002-July/026408.html
      No progress; the last time this was brought up only Marc-Andre
      Lemburg said he had a use for it.  I need to find out exactly
      what that need is and how much of the buffer object we can retire.

    - Lazily tracking tuples?
      http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2002-May/023926.html
      http://www.python.org/sf/558745
      Not much enthusiasm I believe.

    - Timeout sockets.  Completed.
      http://www.python.org/sf/555085

    - Making None a keyword.  Can't be done right away, but a warning
      would be a first step.
      http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2002-April/023600.html
      Ditto for 'as', which has been a pseudo-keyword long enough.

    - Stage 2 of the int/long integration (PEP 237).  This mostly
      means warning about situations where hex, oct or shift of an int
      returns a different value than for the same value as a long.  I
      propose *not* to change the semantics this time; that will
      happen in the next release, still with a warning.  (I think the
      PEP misses this step, but it's necessary -- we can't just change
      the semantics silently without warning first.)  Does this need a
      __future__ statement???

    - Nuke SET_LINENO from all code objects (providing a different way
      to set debugger breakpoints).  This can boost pystone by >5%.
      http://www.python.org/sf/587993 awaiting review.

    - Write a pymemcompat.h that people can bundle with their
      extensions and then use the 2.3 memory interface with all
      Pythons in the range 1.5.2 to 2.3.  (Michael Hudson has done
      this; it's in Misc/pymemcompat.h.)

    - PEP 262  Database of Installed Python Packages        Kuchling

      Andrew is still hopeful that he'll implement this.

    - Add support for the long-awaited Python catalog.  Kapil
      Thangavelu is working on an implementation (he's planning a demo
      for OSCON 2002).  What else is needed?

    - PEP 286  Enhanced Argument Tuples                     von Loewis

      I haven't had the time to review this thoroughly.  It seems a
      deep optimization hack (also makes better correctness guarantees
      though).

    - Warn when an extension type's tp_compare returns anything except
      -1, 0 or 1.  http://www.python.org/sf/472523  (This is done.)

    - A standard datetime type.  An implementation effort is under way:
      http://www.zope.org/Members/fdrake/DateTimeWiki/FrontPage
      Effbot and MAL have a proposal for a basic interface that all
      datetime types should implement, but there are some problems with
      UTC.  A decision needs to be made.

    - Decide on a clearer deprecation policy (especially for modules)
      and act on it.  For a start, see this message from Neil Norwitz:
      http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2002-April/023165.html

    - Add a new concept, "pending deprecation", with associated
      warning PendingDeprecationWarning.  This warning is normally
      suppressed, but can be enabled by a suitable -W option.  (This
      has been added now, but nothing uses it yet.)

    - Use pending deprecation for the types and string modules.  This
      requires providing alternatives for the parts that aren't
      covered yet (e.g. string.whitespace and types.TracebackType).

    - Documentation: complete the distribution and installation
      manuals.

    - Documentation: complete the documentation for new-style
      classes.

    - Look over the Demos/ directory and update where required.

    - New tests.

    - Fix doc bugs on SF.

    - Remove use of deprecated features in the core.

    - Doc deprecated features appropriately

    - Move deprecated features under Py_DEPRECATED (or whatever is decided)

    - Deprecate modules which are unmaintained, or perhaps make a new
      category for modules 'Unmaintained'

    - In general, lots of cleanup so it is easier to move forward.

Introduction

    Pickling new-style objects in Python 2.2 is done somewhat clumsily
    and causes pickle size to bloat compared to classic class
    instances.  This PEP documents a new pickle protocol that takes
    care of this and many other pickling issues.

    (XXX The rest of this PEP is TBD.)

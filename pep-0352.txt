Abstract
========

In Python 2.4 and before, any (classic) class can be raised as an
exception.  The plan is to allow new-style classes starting in Python
2.5, but this makes the problem worse -- it would mean *any* class (or
instance) can be raised! (This is not the case in the final version;
only built-in exceptions can be new-style which means you need to
inherit from a built-in exception to have user-defined exceptions also
be new-style)  This is a problem because it
prevents any guarantees from being made about the interface of exceptions.
This PEP proposes introducing a new superclass that all raised objects
must inherit from.  Imposing the restriction will allow a standard
interface for exceptions to exist that can be relied upon.

One might counter that requiring a specific base class for a
particular interface is unPythonic.  However, in the specific case of
exceptions there's a good reason (which has generally been agreed to
on python-dev): requiring hierarchy helps code that wants to *catch*
exceptions by making it possible to catch *all* exceptions explicitly
by writing ``except BaseException:`` instead of
``except *:``. [#hierarchy-good]_

Introducing a new superclass for exceptions also gives us the chance
to rearrange the exception hierarchy slightly for the better.  As it
currently stands, all exceptions in the built-in namespace inherit
from Exception.  This is a problem since this includes two exceptions
(KeyboardInterrupt and SystemExit) that often need to be excepted from
the application's exception handling: the default behavior of shutting
the interpreter down with resp. without a traceback is usually more
desirable than whatever the application might do (with the possible
exception of applications that emulate Python's interactive command
loop with ``>>>`` prompt).  Changing it so that these two exceptions
inherit from the common superclass instead of Exception will make it
easy for people to write ``except`` clauses that are not overreaching
and not catch exceptions that should propagate up.

This PEP is based on previous work done for PEP 348 [#pep348]_.


Requiring a Common Superclass
=============================

This PEP proposes introducing a new exception named BaseException that
is a new-style class and has a single attribute, ``message`` (that
will cause the deprecation of the existing ``args`` attribute)  Below
is the code as the exception will work in Python 3.0 (how it will
work in Python 2.x is covered in the `Transition Plan`_ section)::

  class BaseException(object):

      """Superclass representing the base of the exception hierarchy.

      Provides a 'message' attribute that contains either the single
      argument to the constructor or the empty string.  This attribute
      is used in both the string and unicode representation for the
      exception.  This is so that it provides the extra details in the
      traceback.

      """

      def __init__(self, message=''):
          """Set the 'message' attribute'"""
          self.message = message

      def __str__(self):
          """Return the str of 'message'"""
          return str(self.message)

      def __unicode__(self):
          """Return the unicode of 'message'"""
          return unicode(self.message)

      def __repr__(self):
          return "%s(%s)" % (self.__class__.__name__, repr(self.message))

The ``message`` attribute will contain either the first argument
passed in at instantiation of the object or the empty string if no
arguments were passed in.  The attribute is meant to act as a common
location to store any extra information that is to be passed along
with the exception that goes beyond the location of the exception
within the exception hierarchy and the exception's type.

No restriction is placed upon what may be passed in for ``messsage``.
This provides backwards-compatibility with how the arguments passed
into Exception have no restrictions.

The ``args`` attribute is deprecated.  While allowing multiple
arguments to be passed can be helpful, it is in no way essential.  It
also does not make it clear which argument is going to be represented
by the ``__str__`` method.  Restricting initialization to accepting a
single argument keeps the API simple and clear.  This also means
providing a ``__getitem__`` method is unneeded for exceptions and thus
will be deprecated as well.

The ``raise`` statement will be changed to require that any object
passed to it must inherit from BaseException.  This will make sure
that all exceptions fall within a single hierarchy that is anchored at
BaseException [#hierarchy-good]_.  This also guarantees a basic
interface that is inherited from BaseException.  The change to
``raise`` will be enforced starting in Python 3.0 (see the `Transition
Plan`_ below).

With BaseException being the root of the exception hierarchy,
Exception will now inherit from it.


Exception Hierarchy Changes
===========================

With the exception hierarchy now even more important since it has a
basic root, a change to the existing hierarchy is called for.  As it
stands now, if one wants to catch all exceptions that signal an error
*and* do not mean the interpreter should be allowed to exit, you must
specify all but two exceptions specifically in an ``except`` clause
or catch the two exceptions separately and then re-raise them and
have all other exceptions fall through to a bare ``except`` clause::

 except (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit):
     raise
 except:
     ...

That is needlessly explicit.  This PEP proposes moving
KeyboardInterrupt and SystemExit to inherit directly from
BaseException.

::

  - BaseException
    |- KeyboardInterrupt
    |- SystemExit
    |- Exception
       |- (all other current built-in exceptions)

Doing this makes catching Exception more reasonable.  It would catch
only exceptions that signify errors.  Exceptions that signal that the
intepreter should exit will not be caught and thus be allowed to
propagate up and allow the interpreter to terminate.

KeyboardInterrupt has been moved since users typically expect an
application to exit when the press the interrupt key (usually Ctrl-C).
If people have overly broad ``except`` clauses the expected behaviour
does not occur.

SystemExit has been moved for similar reasons.  Since the exception is
raised when ``sys.exit()`` is called the interpreter should normally
be allowed to terminate.  Unfortunately overly broad ``except``
clauses can prevent the explicitly requested exit from occurring.

To make sure that people catch Exception most of the time, various
parts of the documentation and tutorials will need to be updated to
strongly suggest that Exception be what programmers want to use.  Bare
``except`` clauses or catching BaseException directly should be
discouraged based on the fact that KeyboardInterrupt and SystemExit
almost always should be allowed to propagate up.


Transition Plan
===============

Since semantic changes to Python are being proposed, a transition plan
is needed.  The goal is to end up with the new semantics being used in
Python 3.0 while providing a smooth transition for 2.x code.  All
deprecations mentioned in the plan will lead to the removal of the
semantics starting in the version following the introduction of the
deprecation and the raising of a DeprecationWarning for the version
specifically listed.

Here is BaseException as implemented in the 2.x series::

  class BaseException(object):

      """Superclass representing the base of the exception hierarchy.

      Provides a 'message' attribute that contains any single argument
      passed in during instantiation.  If more than one argument is
      passed, it is set to the empty string.  It is meant to represent
      any message (usually some text) that should be printed out with
      the traceback.  Unfortunately, for backwards-compatibility, the
      'args' attribute (discussed below) is used for printing out to
      tracebacks.

      The 'args' attribute and __getitem__ method are provided for
      backwards-compatibility and will be deprecated at some point.

      """

      def __init__(self, *args):
          """Set 'message' and 'args' attribute.

          'args' will eventually be deprecated.  But it is still used
          when printing out tracebacks for backwards-compatibility.
          Once 'args' is removed, though, 'message' will be used instead.

          """
          self.args = args
          self.message = args[0] if args else ''

      def __str__(self):
          """Return the str of args[0] or args, depending on length.
  
          Once 'args' has been removed, 'message' will be used
          exclusively for the str representation for exceptions.
  
          """
          return str(self.args[0]
                     if len(self.args) <= 1
                     else self.args)

      def __unicode__(self):
          """Return the unicode of args[0] or args, depending on length.

          Once 'args' has been removed, 'message' will be used
          exclusively for the unicode representation of exceptions.

          """
          return unicode(self.args[0]
                         if len(self.args) <= 1
                         else self.args)

      def __repr__(self):
          func_args = repr(self.args) if self.args else "()"
          return self.__class__.__name__ + func_args

      def __getitem__(self, index):
          """Index into arguments passed in during instantiation.

          Provided for backwards-compatibility and will be
          deprecated.

          """
          return self.args[index]


Deprecation of features in Python 2.9 is optional.  This is because it
is not known at this time if Python 2.9 (which is slated to be the
last version in the 2.x series) will actively deprecate features that
will not be in 3.0 .  It is conceivable that no deprecation warnings
will be used in 2.9 since there could be such a difference between 2.9
and 3.0 that it would make 2.9 too "noisy" in terms of warnings.  Thus
the proposed deprecation warnings for Python 2.9 will be revisited
when development of that version begins to determine if they are still
desired.

* Python 2.5

  - all standard exceptions become new-style classes

  - introduce BaseException

  - Exception, KeyboardInterrupt, and SystemExit inherit from BaseException

  - deprecate raising string exceptions

* Python 2.6

  - deprecate catching string exceptions
  
* Python 2.7

  - deprecate raising exceptions that do not inherit from BaseException

* Python 2.8

  - deprecate catching exceptions that do not inherit from BaseException

* Python 2.9
  
  - deprecate ``args`` and ``__getitem__`` (optional)

* Python 3.0

  - drop everything that was deprecated above:

    + drop string exceptions (could do this sooner?)

    + all exceptions must inherit from BaseException

    + drop ``args`` and ``__getitem__``


Implementation
==============

The initial implementation of this PEP has been checked into Python 2.5 .

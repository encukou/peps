Abstract

    This document describes the development and release schedule for
    Python 2.5.  The schedule primarily concerns itself with PEP-sized
    items.  Small features may be added up to and including the first
    beta release.  Bugs may be fixed until the final release.

    There will be at least two alpha releases, two beta releases, and
    one release candidate.  The release date is planned 19 August 2006.


Release Manager

    Anthony Baxter has volunteered to be Release Manager.
    Martin von Loewis, Barry Warsaw, and Neal Norwitz volunteered
    to assist Anthony as Release Manager.

    Ronald Oussoren is building the Mac installers,
    Fred Drake the doc packages and
    Sean Reifschneider the RPMs.

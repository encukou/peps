Abstract

    This document describes the development and release schedule for
    Python 2.5.  The schedule primarily concerns itself with PEP-sized
    items.  Small features may be added up to and including the first
    beta release.  Bugs may be fixed until the final release.

    There will be at least two alpha releases, two beta releases, and
    one release candidate.  The release date is planned 19 August 2006.


Release Manager

    Anthony Baxter has volunteered to be Release Manager.
    Martin von Loewis, Barry Warsaw, and Neal Norwitz volunteered
    to assist Anthony as Release Manager.

    Martin von Loewis is building the Windows installers,
    Fred Drake the doc packages, and
    TBD (Sean Reifschneider?) the RPMs.

    alpha 1: April 1, 2006 [planned]
    alpha 2: April 29, 2006 [planned]

    beta 1:  June 24, 2006 [planned]

Completed features for 2.5

    PEP 308: Conditional Expressions
    PEP 309: Partial Function Application
    PEP 314: Metadata for Python Software Packages v1.1
        (should PEP 314 be marked final?)
    PEP 341: Unified try-except/try-finally to try-except-finally
    PEP 342: Coroutines via Enhanced Generators
    PEP 353: Using ssize_t as the index type

    - AST-based compiler

    - Add support for reading shadow passwords (http://python.org/sf/579435)

    - any()/all() builtin truth functions

    - new hashlib module add support for SHA-224, -256, -384, and -512
      (replaces old md5 and sha modules)

    - new cProfile module suitable for profiling long running applications
      with minimal overhead

    - Fredrik Lundh's ElementTree and cElementTree


Planned features for 2.5

    Target for inclusion of each feature by March 16.  At that point,
    we should re-evaluate schedule or consider dropping feature.

    PEP 328: Absolute/Relative Imports
    http://python.org/sf/1438387

    PEP 343: The "with" Statement
    Mike Bland posted a partial patch that needs review.
    Patch needs __future__ support for with statement.
    (nn: I have __future__ support partially complete.)
    http://python.org/sf/1435715
    
        Note there are two separate implementation parts:
        interpreter changes and python code for utilities.
        The patch includes both parts.

    PEP 352: Required Superclass for Exceptions
    (Brett Cannon is expected to implement this.)

    Access to C AST from Python

    Add bdist_msi to the distutils package. (MvL plans to import after pycon)

    Add bdist_deb to the distutils package?
    (see http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2006-February/060926.html)

    Add bdist_egg to the distutils package???

    Add setuptools to the standard library.

    Add wsgiref to the standard library.  
    (Phillip Eby has volunteered to maintain it.)

    Add ctypes to the standard library, make it an optional component
    in the windows installer.  Thomas Heller will maintain it.

    (GvR: I have a bunch more that could/would/should be added. -- Still true?)


Deferred until 2.6:

    - None


Open issues

    This PEP needs to be updated and release managers confirmed.

    - Review PEP  4: Deprecate and/or remove the modules

    Should PEP 338 or 357 be accepted and implemented.

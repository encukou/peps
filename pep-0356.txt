Abstract

    This document describes the development and release schedule for
    Python 2.5.  The schedule primarily concerns itself with PEP-sized
    items.  Small features may be added up to and including the first
    beta release.  Bugs may be fixed until the final release.

    There will be at least two alpha releases, two beta releases, and
    one release candidate.  The release date is planned 30 September 2006.


Release Manager

    TBD (Anthony Baxter? If he's unavailable Martin von Loewis has
    volunteered.)

    Martin von Loewis is building the Windows installers,
    Fred Drake the doc packages, and
    TBD (Sean Reifschneider?) the RPMs.


Release Schedule

    alpha 1: May 6, 2006 [planned]
    alpha 2: June 3, 2006 [planned]
    alpha 3: July 1, 2006 [planned]
    beta 1:  July 29, 2006 [planned]
    beta 2:  August 26, 2006 [planned]

Completed features for 2.5

    PEP 309: Partial Function Application
    PEP 314: Metadata for Python Software Packages v1.1
        (should PEP 314 be marked final?)
    PEP 341: Unified try-except/try-finally to try-except-finally
    PEP 342: Coroutines via Enhanced Generators

    - AST-based compiler

    - Add support for reading shadow passwords (http://python.org/sf/579435)

    - any()/all() builtin truth functions

    - new hashlib module add support for SHA-224, -256, -384, and -512
      (replaces old md5 and sha modules)

    - new cProfile module suitable for profiling long running applications
      with minimal overhead

    - Fredrik Lundh's ElementTree and cElementTree


Planned features for 2.5

    PEP 308: Conditional Expressions
    (Someone volunteered on python-dev, is there progress?)

    PEP 328: Absolute/Relative Imports
    (Needs volunteer, mail python-dev if interested)

    PEP 343: The "with" Statement
    (nn: I have a possible volunteer.)
    
        Note there are two separate implementation parts:
        interpreter changes and python code for utilities.

    PEP 352: Required Superclass for Exceptions
    (Brett Cannon is expected to implement this.)

    PEP 353: Using ssize_t as the index type
    MvL expects this to be complete in March.

    Access to C AST from Python

    Add bdist_msi to the distutils package.  (MvL wants one more
    independent release first.)

    Add bdist_deb to the distutils package?
    (see http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2006-February/060926.html)

    Add bdist_egg to the distutils package???

    Add setuptools to the standard library.

    Add wsgiref to the standard library.  
    (Phillip Eby has volunteered to maintain it.)

    (GvR: I have a bunch more that could/would/should be added. -- Still true?)


Deferred until 2.6:

    - None


Open issues

    This PEP needs to be updated and release managers confirmed.

    - Review PEP  4: Deprecate and/or remove the modules

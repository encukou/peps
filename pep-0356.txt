Abstract

    This document describes the development and release schedule for
    Python 2.5.  The schedule primarily concerns itself with PEP-sized
    items.  Small features may be added up to and including the first
    beta release.  Bugs may be fixed until the final release.

    There will be at least two alpha releases, two beta releases, and
    one release candidate.  The release date is planned 19 August 2006.


Release Manager

    Anthony Baxter has volunteered to be Release Manager.
    Martin von Loewis, Barry Warsaw, and Neal Norwitz volunteered
    to assist Anthony as Release Manager.

    Martin von Loewis is building the Windows installers,
    Fred Drake the doc packages, and
    Sean Reifschneider the RPMs.

Planned features for 2.5

    Target for inclusion of each feature by March 16.  At that point,
    we should re-evaluate schedule or consider dropping feature.

    Prepare for 'do' becoming a keyword in 2.6 (PEP 315)?
    And as long as we're going wild, how about 'super'?
    And what about 'interface' and 'implements'? (PEP 245)
    Or 'switch' and 'case'? (PEP 275)

    Add builtin @deprecated decorator?

    PEP 352: Required Superclass for Exceptions
    (Brett Cannon is expected to implement this.)

    - ASCII is the default coding

    Add bdist_msi to the distutils package. (MvL plans to import after pycon)

    Add bdist_deb to the distutils package?
    (see http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2006-February/060926.html)

    Add bdist_egg to the distutils package???

    Add setuptools to the standard library.

    Add wsgiref to the standard library.  
    (Phillip Eby has volunteered to maintain it.)

    Add ctypes to the standard library, make it an optional component
    in the windows installer.  Thomas Heller will maintain it.

    Add pure python pgen module.

    Add support for the Unicode 4.1 UCD.


Deferred until 2.6:

    - None


Open issues

    This PEP needs to be updated and release managers confirmed.

    - Review PEP  4: Deprecate and/or remove the modules

    Should PEP 338 or 357 be accepted and implemented.

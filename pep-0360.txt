Abstract
========

There are many great pieces of Python software developed outside of
the Python standard library (a.k.a., the "stdlib").  Sometimes it
makes sense to incorporate these externally maintained packages into
the stdlib in order to fill a gap in the tools provided by Python.

But by having the packages maintained externally it means Python's
developers do not have direct control over the packages' evolution and
maintenance.  Some package developers prefer to have bug reports and
patches go through them first instead of being directly applied to
Python's repository.

This PEP is meant to record details of packages in the stdlib that are
maintained outside of Python's repository.  Specifically, it is meant
to keep track of any specific maintenance needs for each package.  It
also is meant to allow people to know which version of a package is
released with which version of Python.


Externally Maintained Packages
==============================

The section title is the name of the package as it is known outside of
the Python standard library.  The "standard library name" is what the
package is named within Python.  The "contact person" is the Python
developer in charge of maintaining the package.  The "synchronisation
history" lists what external version of the package was included in
each version of Python (if different from the previous Python
release).


ctypes
------

:Web site:
    http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/
:Standard library name:
    ctypes
:Contact person:
    Thomas Heller
:Synchronisation history:
    * 0.9.9.6 (2.5)

Bugs can be reported to either the Python tracker [#python-tracker]_
or the ctypes tracker [#ctypes-tracker]_ and assigned to
Thomas Heller.


ElementTree
-----------

:Web site:
    http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm
:Standard library name:
    xml.etree
:Contact person:
    Fredrik Lundh
:Synchronisation history:
    * 1.2.6 [ElementTree] / 1.0.5 [cElementTree] (2.5)

Patches should not be directly applied to Python HEAD, but instead
reported to the Python tracker [#python-tracker]_ (critical bug fixes
are the exception).  Bugs should also be reported to the Python
tracker.  Both bugs and patches should be assigned to Fredrik Lundh.


Expat XML parser
----------------

:Web site:
    http://www.libexpat.org/
:Standard library name:
    N/A (this refers to the parser itself, and not the Python
    bindings)
:Contact person:
    None
:Synchronisation history:
    * 1.95.8 (2.4)
    * 1.95.7 (2.3)


Optik
-----

:Web site:
    http://optik.sourceforge.net/
:Standard library name:
    optparse
:Contact person:
    Greg Ward
:Synchronisation history:
    * 1.5.1 (2.5)
    * 1.5a1 (2.4)
    * 1.4   (2.3)


pysqlite
--------

:Web site:
    http://www.sqlite.org/
:Standard library name:
    sqlite3
:Contact person:
    Gerhard HÃ¤ring
:Synchronisation history:
    * 2.2.2 (2.5)

Bugs should be reported to the pysqlite bug
tracker [#pysqlite-tracker]_ as well as any patches that are not
deemed critical.

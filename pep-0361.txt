Abstract

    This document describes the development and release schedule for
    Python 2.6.  The schedule primarily concerns itself with PEP-sized
    items.  Small features may be added up to and including the first
    beta release.  Bugs may be fixed until the final release.

    There will be at least two alpha releases, two beta releases, and
    one release candidate.  The release date is planned to be in XXX 2008.


Release Manager and Crew

    XXX volunteered to be Release Manager.

    XXX is building the Windows installers,
    XXX is building the Mac installers,
    XXX the doc packages and
    XXX the RPMs.


Release Schedule

    Note that this schedule is completely tentative. The number of alphas,
    betas and release candidates will be determined as the release process
    unfolds.  The minimal schedule is:

        June 2007:  (re)confirm the crew and start deciding on schedule.
                    The initial 2.6 target is for April 2008.

        alpha 1: T - 16 weeks [planned]
        alpha 2: T - 13 weeks [planned]
        beta 1:  T -  9 weeks [planned]
        beta 2:  T -  5 weeks [planned]
        rc 1:    T -  1 week  [planned]
        final:   T [planned]


Completed features for 2.6

    PEPs:

        352: Raising a string exception now triggers a TypeError.
             Attempting to catch a string exception raises DeprecationWarning.
             BaseException.message has been deprecated.

    New modules in the standard library:

        None

    Deprecated modules and functions in the standard library:

        - commands.getstatus()
        - macostools.touched()
        - MimeWriter
        - popen2, os.popen[234]()
        - posixfile
        - sets

    Modules removed from the standard library:

        - gopherlib
        - rgbimg
        - macfs

    Python 3.0 compatability:

        - warnings were added for the following builtins
          which no longer exist in 3.0:

             apply, callable, coerce, dict.has_key, execfile, reduce, reload

    Other major features:

      - with/as will be keywords
      - a __dir__() special method to control dir() was added [1]


Possible features for 2.6

    New features *should* be implemented prior to alpha2, particularly
    any C modifications or behavioral changes.  New features *must* be
    implemented prior to beta1 or will require Release Manager approval.

    The following PEPs are being worked on for possible inclusion in 2.6:

        - PEP 297:  Support for System Upgrades [#pep297]
        - PEP 358:  The "bytes" Object [#pep358]
        - PEP 367:  New Super [#pep367]
        - PEP 3112:  Bytes literals in Python 3000 [#pep3112]
        - PEP 3127:  Integer Literal Support and Syntax [#pep3127]

    Each non-trivial feature listed here that is not a PEP must be 
    discussed on python-dev.  Other enhancements include:

        - distutils replacement (requires a PEP)
        - turtle.py replacement or enhancements

    New modules in the standard library:

        - winerror
          http://python.org/sf/1505257
          (Owner: MAL)

        - JSON implementation

        - setuptools

          http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2006-April/063964.html

          PJE's withdrawal from 2.5 for inclusion in 2.6:
          http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2006-April/064145.html

    Modules to gain a DeprecationWarning (as specified for Python 2.6
    or through negligence):

        - rfc822
        - mimetools
        - mimify
        - multifile
        - md5
        - sha
        - buildtools
        - cfmfile
        - compiler package

    - warnings module implemented in C
      * Convert Parser/*.c to use warnings module rather than printf

    - Add warnings for Py3k features removed:
      * backticks and <>
      * __getslice__/__setslice__/__delslice__
      * float args to PyArgs_ParseTuple
      * float args to xrange
      * coerce and all its friends
      * comparing by default comparison
      * __cmp__?
      * other comparison changes?
      * int division?
      * {}.has_key()
      * All PendingDeprecationWarnings (e.g. exceptions)
      * using zip() result as a list
      * the exec statement (use function syntax)
      * file.xreadlines
      * function attributes that start with func_* (should use __*__)
      * softspace removal for print() function
      * the L suffix for long literals
      * removal of modules because of PEP 4/3100/3108
      * renaming of __nonzero__ to __bool__
      * multiple inheritance with classic classes? (MRO might change)
      * properties and classic classes? (instance attrs shadow property)

    - use __bool__ method if available and there's no __nonzero__

    - Check the various bits of code in Demo/ and Tools/ all still work,
      update or remove the ones that don't.

    - All modules in Modules/ should be updated to be ssize_t clean.

    - All of Python (including Modules/) should compile cleanly with g++

    - Start removing deprecated features and generally moving towards Py3k

    - Replace all old style tests (operate on import) with unittest or docttest

    - Add tests for all untested modules

    - Document undocumented modules/features

    - bdist_deb in distutils package
      http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2006-February/060926.html

    - bdist_egg in distutils package

    - pure python pgen module
      (Owner: Guido)
      Deferral to 2.6:
      http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2006-April/064528.html

    - Remove the fpectl module?


Deferred until 2.7

    None

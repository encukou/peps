Abstract
========

Python has always supported powerful introspection capabilities,
including that for functions.  Taking a function object, you can fully
reconstruct the function signature using ``func_defaults``,
``func_code.co_argcount``, ``func_code.co_flags``, and
``func_code.co_varnames``.  Unfortunately this is a little unruly
having to look at four different attributes to pull together complete
information for a function's signature.

This PEP proposes an object representation for function signatures.
This should help facilitate introspection on functions.  It also helps
for introspection for decorators that wrap the function they are
applied to by allowing the wrapped function's signature object be set
for the wrapping function.


Signature Object
================

The overall signature of an object is represented by the Signature
object.  This object is to store Parameter objects (discussed later)
along with any information about the function itself and any
parameters that are highly unique (.e.g, ``*args``).

A Signature object has the following structure attributes:

* name:str
    Name of the function.
* var_args:str
    Name of the ``*args`` parameter, if present, else the empty
    string.
* var_kw_args:str
    Name of the ``**kwargs`` parameter, if present, else the empty
    string.
* parameters:list(Parameter)
    List of the parameters of the function are represented by
    Parameter objects (see `Parameter Object`_ for their
    description).

The Signature object is stored in the ``__signature__`` attribute of
the function.  When it is to be created is an `Open Issues`_.


Parameter Object
================

A function's signature is partially made up of several parameters.
Python's different kinds of parameters is quite large and rich and
continues to grow.  This means that Parameter objects require they
represent any possible parameter.

Originally the plan was to represent parameters using a list of
parameter names on the Signature object along with various dicts keyed
on parameter names to disseminate the various possible pieces of
information one can know about a parameter.  But the decision was made
to incorporate all information about a parameter in a single argument
so as to make extending the information easier.  This was originally
put forth by Talin and the preferred form of Guido (as discussed at
the 2006 Google Sprint).

The structure of the Parameter object is:

* name:(str | tuple(str))
    The name of the parameter as a string if it is not a tuple.  If
    the argument is a tuple, use a tuple of strings where each item is
    the name of the parameter contained within the tuple.
* position:int
    The position of the parameter within the signature of the
    function (zero-indexed).
* has_default:bool
    True if the parameter has a default value, else False.
* default_value:object
    The default value for the parameter, if present, else the
    attribute does not exist.  This is done so that the attribute is
    not accidentally used if no default value is set as any default
    value could be a legitimate default value itself.


Implementation
==============

An implementation is forthcoming for experimentation purposes based on
the 'inspect' module [#inspect-module]_.  The classes will be exposed
in the 'inspect' module as well.  This PEP has been posted without
implementation so as to not be a hinderance to another PEP that is
under development by another author.


Relation With Other PEPs
========================

"Keyword-Only Arguments [#pep-3102]_
------------------------------------

If keyword-only parameters come into existence, the Parameter object
will require modification.  A ``keyword_only`` attribute will be added
that holds a boolean representing whether the parameter is
keyword-only or not.

Nick Coghlan suggested to set 'position' to None to signal that the
argument is keyword-only and thus remove the need for the new
attribute.  But that would cause different types to be used in the
attribute that are in no way compatible.  It also removes the ability
to know the position number within the signature from the Paramter
object itself.  Plus Guido preferred the original approach over this
alternative.


Open Issues
===========

When to construct the Parameter object?
---------------------------------------

The Parameter object can either be created in an eager or lazy
fashion.  In the eager situation, the object can be created during
creation of the function object.  In the lazy situation, one would
pass a function object to ``inspect.getsignature()`` and that would
generate the Signature object and store it to ``__signature__`` if
needed, and then return the value of ``__signature__``.

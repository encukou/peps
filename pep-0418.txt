Abstract
========

Add time.monotonic(), time.highres(), time.get_clock_info(name) functions to
Python 3.3.


Rationale
=========

Use cases:

* Display the current time to a human (e.g. display a calendar or draw
  a wall clock): use system clock, i.e. time.time() or
  datetime.datetime.now().
* Benchmark, profiling: time.highres().
* Event scheduler, timeout: time.monotonic().


Functions
=========

To fulfill the use cases, the functions' properties are:

* time.time(): system clock, "wall clock".
* time.highres(): clock with the best accuracy.
* time.monotonic(): monotonic clock, or system clock if no monotonic
  clock is available
* time.get_clock_info(name): get information on the specified time function


time.time()
-----------

The system time is the "wall clock". It can be set manually by the
system administrator or automatically by a NTP daemon.  It can jump
backward and forward.  It is not monotonic.

It is available on all platforms and cannot fail.

Pseudo-code [#pseudo]_::

    if os.name == "nt":
        def time():
            return _time.GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()
    else:
        def time():
            if hasattr(time, "clock_gettime"):
                try:
                    # resolution = 1 nanosecond
                    return time.clock_gettime(time.CLOCK_REALTIME)
                except OSError:
                    # CLOCK_REALTIME is not supported (unlikely)
                    pass
            if hasattr(_time, "gettimeofday"):
                try:
                    # resolution = 1 microsecond
                    return _time.gettimeofday()
                except OSError:
                    # gettimeofday() should not fail
                    pass
            if hasattr(_time, "ftime"):
                # resolution = 1 millisecond
                return _time.ftime()
            else:
                # resolution = 1 second
                return _time.time()


time.monotonic()
----------------

Monotonic clock, or system clock if the platform does not provide a monotonic
clock (e.g. on GNU/Hurd). Its rate is as steady as possible. Its rate may be
adjusted by NTP.  The reference point of the returned value is undefined so
only the difference of consecutive calls is valid.

Use time.get_clock_info('monotonic')['monotonic'] to check if the clock
monotonic or not.

The elapsed time may or may not include time the system spends in
sleep or hibernation; this depends on the operating system.

Pseudo-code [#pseudo]_::

    if os.name == 'nt':
        # GetTickCount64() requires Windows Vista, Server 2008 or later
        if hasattr(time, '_GetTickCount64'):
            def monotonic():
                return _time.GetTickCount64()
        else:
            def monotonic():
                ticks = _time.GetTickCount()
                if ticks < monotonic.last:
                    # Integer overflow detected
                    monotonic.delta += 2**32
                monotonic.last = ticks
                return ticks + monotonic.delta
            monotonic.last = 0
            monotonic.delta = 0

    elif os.name == 'mac':
        def monotonic():
            if monotonic.factor is None:
                factor = _time.mach_timebase_info()
                monotonic.factor = timebase[0] / timebase[1]
            return _time.mach_absolute_time() * monotonic.factor
        monotonic.factor = None

    elif os.name.startswith('sunos'):
        def monotonic():
            if monotonic.use_clock_highres:
                try:
                    time.clock_gettime(time.CLOCK_HIGHRES)
                except OSError:
                    monotonic.use_clock_highres = False
            if monotonic.use_gethrtime:
                try:
                    return time.gethrtime()
                except OSError:
                    monotonic.use_gethrtime = False
            return time.time()
        monotonic.use_clock_highres = (hasattr(time, 'clock_gettime')
                                       and hasattr(time, 'CLOCK_HIGHRES'))
        monotonic.use_gethrtime = True

    elif hasattr(time, "clock_gettime"):
        def monotonic():
            while monotonic.clocks:
                try:
                    clk_id = monotonic.clocks[0]
                    return time.clock_gettime(clk_id)
                except OSError:
                    # CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW requires a Linux kernel >= 2.6.28
                    del monotonic.clocks[0]
            return time.time()
        monotonic.clocks = []
        if hasattr(time, 'CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW'):
            monotonic.clocks.append(time.CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW)
        if hasattr(time, 'CLOCK_HIGHRES'):
            monotonic.clocks.append(time.CLOCK_HIGHRES)
        monotonic.clocks.append(time.CLOCK_MONOTONIC)

    else:
        def monotonic():
            return time.time()

On Windows, QueryPerformanceCounter() is not used even though it has a
better resolution than GetTickCount().  It is not reliable and has too
many issues.

.. note::

   time.monotonic() detects GetTickCount() integer overflow (32 bits,
   roll-over after 49.7 days): it increases a delta by 2\ :sup:`32`
   each time than an overflow is detected.  The delta is stored in the
   process-local state and so the value of time.monotonic() may be
   different in two Python processes.


time.highres()
--------------

Clock with the best available resolution.

It is available on all platforms and cannot fail.

Pseudo-code::

    def highres():
        if highres.use_performance_counter:
            try:
                return _time.QueryPerformanceCounter()
            except OSError:
                # QueryPerformanceFrequency() may fail, if the installed
                # hardware does not support a high-resolution performance
                # counter for example
                highres.use_performance_counter = False
        if highres.use_monotonic:
            # Monotonic clock is preferred over system clock
            try:
                return time.monotonic()
            except OSError:
                highres.use_monotonic = False
        return time.time()
    highres.use_performance_counter = (os.name == 'nt')
    highres.use_monotonic = hasattr(time, 'monotonic')

time.get_clock_info(name)
-------------------------

Get information on the specified clock. Supported clocks:

 * "clock": time.clock()
 * "highres": time.highres()
 * "monotonic": time.monotonic()
 * "time": time.time()

Return a dictionary with the following keys:

 * Mandatory keys:

   * "function" (str): name of the underlying operating system function.
     Examples: "QueryPerformanceCounter()", "clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME)".
   * "resolution" (float): resolution in seconds of the clock
   * "is_monotonic" (bool): True if the clock cannot go backward

 * Optional keys:

   * "accuracy" (float): accuracy in seconds of the clock
   * "is_adjusted" (bool): True if the clock can be adjusted (e.g. by a NTP
     daemon)


Hardware clocks
===============

* HPET: An HPET chip consists of a 64-bit up-counter (main counter)
  counting at least at 10 MHz and a set of up to 256 comparators (at
  least 3).  Each HPET can have up to 32 timers.
* TSC (Time Stamp Counter): Historically, the TSC increased with every internal
  processor clock cycle, but now the rate is usually constant (even if the
  processor changes frequency) and usually equals the maximum processor
  frequency. The instructor RDTSC can be used to read this counter.
* ACPI PMTMR (power management timer): ACPI 24-bit timer with a frequency
  of 3.5 MHz (3,579,545 Hz). HPET can cause around 3 seconds of drift per day.
* Cyclone: The Cyclone timer uses a 32-bit counter on IBM Extended
  X-Architecture (EXA) chipsets which include computers that use the
  IBM "Summit" series chipsets (ex: x440).  This is available in IA32
  and IA64 architectures.
* PIT (programmable interrupt timer): Intel 8253/8254 chipsets with a
  configurable frequency in range 18.2 Hz - 1.2 MHz. It is a 16-bit counter.
* RTC (Real-time clock). Most RTCs use a crystal oscillator with a frequency of
  32,768 Hz

========================= =============== =============== ================ ====================

(*) The accuracy of monotonic clocks depends on the operating system
and the hardware clock.

The resolution is the smallest difference between two timestamps
supported by the format used by the clock.  For example,
clock_gettime() uses a timespec structure which has two integer
fields, tv_sec and tv_nsec, so the resolution is 1 nanosecond.

The accuracy is the effective smallest difference of two timestamps of
the clock.  It does not reflect the stability the clock rate.  For
example, QueryPerformanceCounter() has a good accuracy but is known to
not have a steady rate.


mach_absolute_time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Mac OS X provides a monotonic clock: mach_absolute_time().  It is
based on absolute elapsed time delta since system boot.  It is not
adjusted and cannot be set.

mach_timebase_info() gives a fraction to convert the clock value to a
number of nanoseconds.  According to the documentation (`Technical Q&A
QA1398 <https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#qa/qa1398/>`_),
mach_timebase_info() is always equal to one and never fails, even
if the function may fail according to its prototype.

mach_absolute_time() stops during a sleep on a PowerPC CPU, but not on
an Intel CPU: `Different behaviour of mach_absolute_time() on i386/ppc
<http://lists.apple.com/archives/PerfOptimization-dev/2006/Jul/msg00024.html>`_.

mach_absolute_time() has a resolution of 1 nanosecond.

CLOCK_MONOTONIC, CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CLOCK_MONOTONIC and CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW represent monotonic time since
some unspecified starting point.  They cannot be set.

Documentation: refer to the manual page of your operating system.
Examples:

* `FreeBSD clock_gettime() manual page
  <http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=clock_gettime>`_
* `Linux clock_gettime() manual page
  <http://linux.die.net/man/3/clock_gettime>`_

CLOCK_MONOTONIC is available at least on the following operating systems:

* DragonFly BSD, FreeBSD >= 5.0, OpenBSD, NetBSD
* Linux
* Solaris

The following operating systems don't support CLOCK_MONOTONIC:

* GNU/Hurd (see `open issues/ clock_gettime
  <http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/open_issues/clock_gettime.html>`_)
* Mac OS X
* Windows

CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW is specific to Linux.  It is similar to
CLOCK_MONOTONIC, but provides access to a raw hardware-based time that
is not subject to NTP adjustments.  CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW requires Linux
2.6.28 or later.

On Linux, NTP may adjust the CLOCK_MONOTONIC rate, but it cannot jump
backward.  If available, CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW should be used instead of
CLOCK_MONOTONIC to avoid the NTP adjustment.

CLOCK_MONOTONIC stops while the machine is suspended.

clock_gettime() fails if the system does not support the specified
clock, even if the standard C library supports it.  For example,
CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW requires a kernel version 2.6.28 or later.

clock_getres() gives the clock resolution.  It is 1 nanosecond on
Linux.

.. note::

   clock_gettime() requires to link the program against the rt
   (real-time) library.


Windows: QueryPerformanceCounter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

High-resolution performance counter.  It is monotonic.
QueryPerformanceFrequency() gives its frequency.

It has a much higher resolution, but has lower long term accuracy than
GetTickCount() and timeGetTime() clocks.  For example, it will drift
compared to the low precision clocks.

Documentation:

* `MSDN: QueryPerformanceCounter() documentation
  <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms644904%28v=vs.85%29.aspx>`_
* `MSDN: QueryPerformanceFrequency() documentation
  <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms644905%28v=vs.85%29.aspx>`_

Hardware clocks used by QueryPerformanceCounter:

* Windows XP: RDTSC instruction of Intel processors, the clock
  frequency is the frequency of the processor (between 200 MHz and 3
  GHz, usually greater than 1 GHz nowadays).
* Windows 2000: ACPI power management timer, frequency = 3,549,545 Hz.
  It can be forced through the "/usepmtimer" flag in boot.ini.

.. * Windows 95/98: 8245 PIT chipset, frequency = 1,193,181 Hz

QueryPerformanceFrequency() should only be called once: the frequency
will not change while the system is running.  It fails if the
installed hardware does not support a high-resolution performance
counter.

QueryPerformanceCounter() cannot be adjusted:
`SetSystemTimeAdjustment()
<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724943(v=vs.85).aspx>`_
only adjusts the system time.

Bugs:

* The performance counter value may unexpectedly leap forward because
  of a hardware bug, see `KB274323`_.
* On VirtualBox, QueryPerformanceCounter() does not increment the high
  part every time the low part overflows, see `Monotonic timers
  <http://code-factor.blogspot.fr/2009/11/monotonic-timers.html>`_
  (2009).
* VirtualBox had a bug in its HPET virtualized device:
  QueryPerformanceCounter() did jump forward by approx. 42 seconds (`issue
  #8707 <https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/8707>`_).
* Windows XP had a bug (see `KB896256`_): on a multiprocessor
  computer, QueryPerformanceCounter() returned a different value for
  each processor.  The bug was fixed in Windows XP SP2.
* Issues with processor with variable frequency: the frequency is changed
  depending on the workload to reduce memory consumption.

Windows: GetTickCount(), GetTickCount64()
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GetTickCount() and GetTickCount64() are monotonic, cannot fail and are
not adjusted by SetSystemTimeAdjustment().  MSDN documentation:
`GetTickCount()
<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724408(v=vs.85).aspx>`_,
`GetTickCount64()
<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724411(v=vs.85).aspx>`_.

The elapsed time retrieved by GetTickCount() or GetTickCount64()
includes time the system spends in sleep or hibernation.

GetTickCount64() was added to Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.

The clock resolution is 1 millisecond.  Its accuracy is usually around
15 ms.  It is possible to improve the accuracy using the `undocumented
NtSetTimerResolution() function
<http://undocumented.ntinternals.net/UserMode/Undocumented%20Functions/Time/NtSetTimerResolution.html>`_.
There are applications using this undocumented function, example:
`Timer Resolution <http://www.lucashale.com/timer-resolution/>`_.

WaitForSingleObject() use the same timer than GetTickCount() with the same
resolution.

GetTickCount() has an accuracy of 55 ms on Windows 9x.


Windows: timeGetTime
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The timeGetTime function retrieves the system time, in milliseconds.
The system time is the time elapsed since Windows was started.  Read
the `timeGetTime() documentation
<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd757629(v=vs.85).aspx>`_.

The return type of timeGetTime() is a 32-bit unsigned integer.  As
GetTickCount(), timeGetTime() rolls over after 2^32 milliseconds (49.7
days).

The default precision of the timeGetTime function can be five
milliseconds or more, depending on the machine.

timeBeginPeriod() can be used to increase the precision of
timeGetTime() up to 1 millisecond, but it negatively affects power
consumption.

.. note::

   timeGetTime() and timeBeginPeriod() are part the Windows multimedia
   library and so require to link the program against winmm or to
   dynamically load the library.


Solaris: CLOCK_HIGHRES
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Solaris OS has a CLOCK_HIGHRES timer that attempts to use an
optimal hardware source, and may give close to nanosecond resolution.
CLOCK_HIGHRES is the nonadjustable, high-resolution clock.  For timers
created with a clockid_t value of CLOCK_HIGHRES, the system will
attempt to use an optimal hardware source.

Solaris: gethrtime
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The gethrtime() function returns the current high-resolution real
time.  Time is expressed as nanoseconds since some arbitrary time in
the past; it is not correlated in any way to the time of day, and thus
is not subject to resetting or drifting by way of adjtime() or
settimeofday().  The hires timer is ideally suited to performance
measurement tasks, where cheap, accurate interval timing is required.

The linearity of gethrtime() is not preserved accross cpr
suspend-resume cycle (`Bug 4272663
<http://wesunsolve.net/bugid/id/4272663>`_).

Read the `gethrtime() manual page of Solaris 11
<http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/821-1465/gethrtime-3c.html#scrolltoc>`_.

On Solaris, gethrtime() is the same as clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC).

========================= =============== ===============

(*) The accuracy of system clocks depends on the operating system and
the hardware clock.  On Windows, the accuracy is in the range 1 ms -
15 ms.


Windows: GetSystemTimeAsFileTime
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The system time can be read using GetSystemTimeAsFileTime(), ftime()
and time().

The system time resolution can be read using
GetSystemTimeAdjustment().  The accuracy is usually between 1
millisecond and 15 milliseconds.  Resolution:

* GetSystemTimeAsFileTime(): 100 nanoseconds
* ftime(): 1 millisecond
* time(): 1 second

The system time can be set using SetSystemTime().

System time on UNIX
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

gettimeofday(), ftime(), time() and clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME)
return the system clock.

Resolution:

* clock_gettime(): clock_getres(CLOCK_REALTIME), 1 nanosecond on Linux
* gettimeofday(): 1 microsecond
* ftime(): 1 millisecond
* time(): 1 second

The system time can be set using settimeofday() or
clock_settime(CLOCK_REALTIME).


Process and thread time
-----------------------

The process and thread time cannot be set.  They are not monotonic:
the clocks stop while the process/thread is idle.

Process
^^^^^^^

* Windows: GetProcessTimes()
* clock_gettime(CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID): High-resolution per-process
  timer from the CPU.
* clock():

  * Windows: The elapsed wall-clock time since the start of the
    process (elapsed time in seconds times CLOCKS_PER_SEC).  It can
    fail.
  * UNIX: returns an approximation of processor time used by the
    program.

* times()
* getrusage(): ru_utime and ru_stime fields

Resolution:

* clock() rate is CLOCKS_PER_SEC.  It was called CLK_TCK in Microsoft
  C before 6.0.  On Linux 3, clock() has a resolution of 1
  microsecond.
* The clock resolution can be read using clock_getres().
  clock_getres(CLOCK_REALTIME) is 1 nanosecond on Linux.
* GetProcessTimes(): call GetSystemTimeAdjustment().

Thread
^^^^^^

* Windows: GetThreadTimes()
* clock_gettime(CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID): Thread-specific CPU-time
  clock.

Resolution:

* CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID: call clock_getres().  1 nanosecond on
  Linux.
* GetThreadTimes(): call GetSystemTimeAdjustment()

See also pthread_getcpuclockid().


Windows: QueryUnbiasedInterruptTime
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Gets the current unbiased interrupt time from the biased interrupt
time and the current sleep bias amount.  This time is not affected by
power management sleep transitions.

The elapsed time retrieved by the QueryUnbiasedInterruptTime function
includes only time that the system spends in the working state.
QueryUnbiasedInterruptTime() is not monotonic.

QueryUnbiasedInterruptTime() was introduced in Windows 7.


Linux timers
------------

There were 4 implementations of the time in the Linux kernel: UTIME
(1996), timer wheel (1997), HRT (2001) and hrtimers (2007).  The
latter is the result of the "high-res-timers" project started by
George Anzinger in 2001, with contributions by Thomas Gleixner and
Douglas Niehaus.  hrtimers implementation was merged into Linux
2.6.21, released in 2007.

hrtimers supports various clock sources.  It sets a priority to each
source to decide which one will be used.

* TSC (Time Stamp Counter): Internal processor clock incremented at
  each processor cycle.  Its frequency is the processor frequency and
  so usually higher than 1 GHz.  Its priority is 300 by default, but
  falls to 0 if the processor frequency changes and the counter
  becomes unstable.
* HPET: An HPET chip consists of a 64-bit up-counter (main counter)
  counting at least at 10 MHz and a set of up to 256 comparators (at
  least 3).  Each HPET can have up to 32 timers.
* PIT (programmable interrupt timer): Intel 8253/8254 chipsets with a
  configurable frequency in range 18.2 Hz - 1.2 MHz.  Linux uses the
  frequency 1,193,181.8 Hz.  It is a 16-bit counter.
* PMTMR (power management timer): ACPI 24-bit timer with a frequency
  of 3.5 MHz (3,579,545 Hz).  Its priority is 200 by default, but
  changes to 110 if the chipset is broken and need a software
  workaround.  HPET can cause around 3 seconds of drift per day.
* Cyclone: The Cyclone timer uses a 32-bit counter on IBM Extended
  X-Architecture (EXA) chipsets which include computers that use the
  IBM "Summit" series chipsets (ex: x440).  This is available in IA32
  and IA64 architectures.

High-resolution timers are not supported on all hardware
architectures.  They are at least provided on x86/x86_64, ARM and
PowerPC.

The list of available clock sources can be read in
/sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/available_clocksource.
It is possible to force a clocksource at runtime by writing its name
into /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource.
/proc/timer_list contains the list of all hardware timers.

Alternatives: API design
========================

Other names for new functions
-----------------------------

time.highres():

* time.hires(): "hires" can be read as "to hire" as in "he hires a car
  to go on holiday", rather than a "HIgh-RESolution clock".
* time.timer(): "it would be too easy to confuse with (or misspell as)
  time.time()"

time.monotonic():

* time.steady(): no OS provides a clock advancing at a steady rate, so
  "steady" should be avoided.
* time.try_monotonic(): it is a clear and obvious solution for the
  use-case of "I prefer the monotonic clock, if it is available,
  otherwise I'll take my chances with a best-effect clock."
* time.wallclock(): it is not the system time aka the "wall clock", but
  a monotonic clock with an unspecified starting point


One function with a flag: time.monotonic(fallback=True)
-------------------------------------------------------

 * time.monotonic(fallback=True) falls back to the system clock if no monotonic
   clock is available or if the monotonic clock failed.
 * time.monotonic(fallback=False) raises OSError if monotonic clock fails and
   NotImplementedError if the system does not provide a monotonic clock

"A keyword argument that gets passed as a constant in the caller is usually
poor API."

Raising NotImplementedError for a function is something uncommon in Python and
should be avoided.


One function, no flag
---------------------

time.monotonic() returns (time: float, is_monotonic: bool).

An alternative is to use a function attribute:
time.monotonic.is_monotonic.  The attribute value would be None before
the first call to time.monotonic().


Working around operating system bugs?
=====================================

Should Python ensure manually that a monotonic clock is truly
monotonic by computing the maximum with the clock value and the
previous value?

Since it's relatively straightforward to cache the last value returned
using a static variable, it might be interesting to use this to make
sure that the values returned are indeed monotonic.

* Virtual machines provide less reliable clocks.
* QueryPerformanceCounter() has known bugs (only one is not fixed yet)

Python may only work around a specific known operating system bug:
`KB274323`_ contains a code example to workaround the bug (use
GetTickCount() to detect QueryPerformanceCounter() leap).


Footnotes
=========

.. [#pseudo] "_time" is an hypothetical module only used for the example.
   The time module is implemented in C and so there is no need for
   such module.

Abstract
========

CPython currently defines an ``__length_hint__`` method on several types, such
as various iterators. This method is then used by various other functions (such as
``map``) to presize lists based on the estimated returned by
``__length_hint__``. Types can then define ``__length_hint__`` which are not
sized, and thus should not define ``__len__``, but can estimate or compute a
size (such as many iterators).

Proposal
========

This PEP proposes formally documenting ``__length_hint__`` for other
interpreter and non-standard library Python to implement.

``__length_hint__`` must return an integer, and is not required to be accurate.
It may return a value that is either larger or smaller than the actual size of
the container. It may raise a ``TypeError`` if a specific instance cannot have
its length estimated. It may not return a negative value.

Rationale
=========

Being able to pre-allocate lists based on the expected size, as estimated by ``__length_hint__``, can be a significant optimization. CPython has been
observed to run some code faster than PyPy, purely because of this optimization
being present.

Open questions
==============

There are two open questions for this PEP:

* Should ``list`` expose a kwarg in it's constructor for supplying a length
  hint.
* Should a function be added either to ``builtins`` or some other module which
  calls ``__length_hint__``, like ``builtins.len`` calls ``__len__``.

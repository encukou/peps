Abstract
========

This document describes the development and release schedule for
Python 3.4.  The schedule primarily concerns itself with PEP-sized
items.

.. Small features may be added up to the first beta
   release.  Bugs may be fixed until the final release,
   which is planned for February 2014.


Release Manager and Crew
========================

- 3.4 Release Manager: Larry Hastings
- Windows installers: Martin v. LÃ¶wis
- Mac installers: Ned Deily / Ronald Oussoren
- Documentation: Georg Brandl


Release Schedule
================

The releases so far:

- 3.4.0 alpha 1: August 3, 2013
- 3.4.0 alpha 2: September 9, 2013
- 3.4.0 alpha 3: September 29, 2013
- 3.4.0 alpha 4: October 20, 2013

The anticipated schedule for future releases:

- 3.4.0 beta 1: November 24, 2013

(Beta 1 is also "feature freeze"--no new features beyond this point.)

- 3.4.0 beta 2: January 5, 2014
- 3.4.0 candidate 1: January 19, 2014
- 3.4.0 candidate 2: February 2, 2014
- 3.4.0 final: February 23, 2014

.. don't forget to update final date above as well

These are the days we expect to release the software;
Python core developers should note that the revision
used for the release will generally be "tagged" the day
before.  However the actual availability of the release
for download on python.org depends on the schedules of
the crew and the existence of any release-blocking issues.

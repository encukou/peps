Abstract
========

Generally only new features are applied to Python 3.4 but this PEP requests an
exception for IDLE [1]_.  IDLE is part of the standard library and has numerous
outstanding issues [2]_.  Since IDLE is often the first thing a new Python user
sees it desperately needs to be brought up to date with modern GUI standards
across the three major platforms Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.  


Rationale
=========

Python does have many advanced features yet Python is well known for being a
easy computer language for beginners [3]_.  A major Python philosophy is
"batteries included" which is best demonstrated in Python's standard library
with many modules that are not typically included with other programming
languages [4]_.  IDLE is a important "battery" in the Python toolbox because it
allows a beginner to get started quickly without downloading and configuring a
third party IDE.  IDLE is primarily used as an application that ships with
Python, rather than as a library module used to build Python applications,
hence a different standard should apply to IDLE enhancements.  Additional
patches to IDLE cannot break any existing program/library because IDLE is used
by humans. 


Details
=======

Python 2.7 does not accept bug fixes, this rule can be ignored for IDLE if the
Python development team accepts this PEP [5]_.  IDLE issues will be carefully
tested on the three major platforms Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows before any
commits are made.  Since IDLE is segregated to a particular part of the source
tree this enhancement exception only applies to Lib/idlelib directory in
Python branches >= 2.7.

Abstract
========

Add new APIs to customize memory allocators


Rationale
=========

Use cases:

* Application embedding Python wanting to use a custom memory allocator
  to allocate all Python memory somewhere else or with a different algorithm
* Python running on embedded devices with low memory and slow CPU.
  A custom memory allocator may be required to use efficiently the memory
  and/or to be able to use all memory of the device.
* Debug tool to track memory leaks
* Debug tool to detect buffer underflow, buffer overflow and misuse
  of Python allocator APIs
* Debug tool to inject bugs, simulate out of memory for example

API:

* Setup a custom memory allocator for all memory allocated by Python
* Hook memory allocator functions to call extra code before and/or after
  the underlying allocator function


Proposal
========

* Add a new ``PyMemAllocators`` structure

* Add new GIL-free memory allocator functions:

  - ``PyMem_RawMalloc()``
  - ``PyMem_RawRealloc()``
  - ``PyMem_RawFree()``

* Add new functions to get and set memory allocators:

  - ``PyMem_GetRawAllocators()``, ``PyMem_SetRawAllocators()``
  - ``PyMem_GetAllocators()``, ``PyMem_SetAllocators()``
  - ``PyObject_GetAllocators()``, ``PyObject_SetAllocators()``
  - ``_PyObject_GetArenaAllocators()``, ``_PyObject_SetArenaAllocators()``

* Add a new function to setup debug hooks after memory allocators were
  replaced:

  - ``PyMem_SetupDebugHooks()``

* ``PyObject_Malloc()`` now falls back on ``PyMem_Malloc()`` instead of
  ``malloc()`` if size is bigger than ``SMALL_REQUEST_THRESHOLD``, and
  ``PyObject_Realloc()`` falls back on ``PyMem_Realloc()`` instead of
  ``realloc()``

* ``PyMem_Malloc()`` and ``PyMem_Realloc()`` now always call ``malloc()`` and
  ``realloc()``, instead of calling ``PyObject_Malloc()`` and
  ``PyObject_Realloc()`` in debug mode


Performances
============

The Python benchmarks suite (-b 2n3): some tests are 1.04x faster, some tests
are 1.04 slower, significant is between 115 and -191. I don't understand these
output, but I guess that the overhead cannot be seen with such test.

pybench: "+0.1%" (diff between -4.9% and +5.6%).

Full output attached to the issue #3329.


Alternatives
============

Only one get and one set function
---------------------------------

Replace the 6 functions:

* ``PyMem_GetRawAllocators()``
* ``PyMem_GetAllocators()``
* ``PyObject_GetAllocators()``
* ``PyMem_SetRawAllocators(allocators)``
* ``PyMem_SetAllocators(allocators)``
* ``PyObject_SetAllocators(allocators)``

with 2 functions with an additional *domain* argument:

* ``Py_GetAllocators(domain)``
* ``Py_SetAllocators(domain, allocators)``

where domain is one of these values:

* ``PYALLOC_PYMEM``
* ``PYALLOC_PYMEM_RAW``
* ``PYALLOC_PYOBJECT``


Setup Builtin Debug Hooks
-------------------------

To be able to use Python debug functions (like ``_PyMem_DebugMalloc()``) even
when a custom memory allocator is set, an environment variable
``PYDEBUGMALLOC`` can be added to set these debug function hooks, instead of
the new function ``PyMem_SetupDebugHooks()``.


Use macros to get customizable allocators
-----------------------------------------

To have no overhead in the default configuration, customizable allocators would
be an optional feature enabled by a configuration option or by macros.


Pass the C filename and line number
-----------------------------------

Use C macros using ``__FILE__`` and ``__LINE__`` to get the C filename
and line number of a memory allocation.


No context argument
-------------------

Simplify the signature of allocator functions, remove the context argument:

* ``void* malloc(size_t size)``
* ``void* realloc(void *ptr, size_t new_size)``
* ``void free(void *ptr)``

The context is a convenient way to reuse the same allocator for different APIs
(ex: PyMem and PyObject).


PyMem_Malloc() GIL-free
-----------------------

There is no real reason to require the GIL when calling PyMem_Malloc().

Memory allocators
=================

The C standard library provides the well known ``malloc()`` function. Its
implementation depends on the platform and of the C library. The GNU C library
uses a modified ptmalloc2, based on "Doug Lea's Malloc" (dlmalloc). FreeBSD
uses `jemalloc <http://www.canonware.com/jemalloc/>`_. Google provides
tcmalloc which is part of `gperftools <http://code.google.com/p/gperftools/>`_.

``malloc()`` uses two kinds of memory: heap and memory mappings. Memory
mappings are usually used for large allocations (ex: larger than 256 KB),
whereas the heap is used for small allocations.

The heap is handled by ``brk()`` and ``sbrk()`` system calls on Linux, and is
contiguous.  Memory mappings are handled by ``mmap()`` on UNIX and
``VirtualAlloc()`` on Windows, they are discontiguous. Releasing a memory
mapping gives back the memory immediatly to the system. For the heap, memory is
only gave back to the system if it is at the end of the heap. Otherwise, the
memory will only gave back to the system when all the memory located after the
released memory are also released. This limitation causes an issue called the
"memory fragmentation": the memory usage seen by the system may be much higher
than real usage.

Windows provides a `Low-fragmentation Heap
<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366750%28v=vs.85%29.aspx>`_.

The Linux kernel uses `slab allocation
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_allocation>`_.

The glib library has a `Memory Slice API
<https://developer.gnome.org/glib/unstable/glib-Memory-Slices.html>`_:
efficient way to allocate groups of equal-sized chunks of memory

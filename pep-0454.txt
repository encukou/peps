Abstract
========

Add a new ``tracemalloc`` module to trace Python memory allocations.



Rationale
=========

Common debug tools tracing memory allocations read the C filename and
number.  Using such tool to analyze Python memory allocations does not
help because most memory allocations are done in the same C function,
``PyMem_Malloc()`` for example.

There are debug tools dedicated to the Python languages like ``Heapy``
and ``PySizer``. These projects analyze objects type and/or content.
These tools are useful when the most memory leak are instances of the
same type and this type in allocated only in a few functions. The
problem is when the object type is very common like ``str`` or
``tuple``, and it is hard to identify where these objects are allocated.

Finding reference cycles is also a difficult task. There are different
tools to draw a diagram of all references. These tools cannot be used
huge on large applications with thousands of objects because the diagram
is too huge to be analyzed manually.


Proposal
========

Using the PEP 445, it becomes easy to setup an hook on Python memory
allocators. The hook can inspect the current Python frame to get the
Python filename and line number.

This PEP proposes to add a new ``tracemalloc`` module. It is a debug
tool to trace memory allocations made by Python. The module provides the
following information:

* Statistics on Python memory allocations per Python filename and line
  number: size, number, and average size of allocations
* Compute differences between two snapshots of Python memory allocations
* Location of a Python memory allocation: size in bytes, Python filename
  and line number


Command line options
====================

The ``python -m tracemalloc`` command can be used to analyze and compare
snapshots. The command takes a list of snapshot filenames and has the
following options.

``-g``, ``--group-per-file``

    Group allocations per filename, instead of grouping per line number.

``-n NTRACES``, ``--number NTRACES``

    Number of traces displayed per top (default: 10).

``--first``

    Compare with the first snapshot, instead of comparing with the
    previous snapshot.

``--include PATTERN``

    Only include filenames matching pattern *PATTERN*. The option can be
    specified multiple times.

    See ``fnmatch.fnmatch()`` for the syntax of patterns.

``--exclude PATTERN``

    Exclude filenames matching pattern *PATTERN*. The option can be
    specified multiple times.

    See ``fnmatch.fnmatch()`` for the syntax of patterns.

``-S``, ``--hide-size``

    Hide the size of allocations.

``-C``, ``--hide-count``

    Hide the number of allocations.

``-A``, ``--hide-average``

    Hide the average size of allocations.

``-P PARTS``, ``--filename-parts=PARTS``

    Number of displayed filename parts (default: 3).

``--color``

    Force usage of colors even if ``sys.stdout`` is not a TTY device.

``--no-color``

    Disable colors if ``sys.stdout`` is a TTY device.


API
===

To trace the most Python memory allocations, the module should be
enabled as early as possible in your application by calling
``tracemalloc.enable()`` function, by setting the ``PYTHONTRACEMALLOC``
environment variable to ``1``, or  by using ``-X tracemalloc`` command
line option.


Functions
---------

``enable()`` function:

    Start tracing Python memory allocations.

``disable()`` function:

    Stop tracing Python memory allocations and stop the timer started by
    ``start_timer()``.

``is_enabled()`` function:

    Get the status of the module: ``True`` if it is enabled, ``False``
    otherwise.

``get_object_address(obj)`` function:

    Get the address of the memory block of the specified Python object.

``get_object_trace(obj)`` function:

    Get the trace of a Python object *obj* as a ``trace`` instance.

    Return ``None`` if the tracemalloc module did not save the location
    when the object was allocated, for example if the module was
    disabled.

``get_process_memory()`` function:

    Get the memory usage of the current process as a meminfo namedtuple
    with two attributes:

    * ``rss``: Resident Set Size in bytes
    * ``vms``: size of the virtual memory in bytes

    Return ``None`` if the platform is not supported.

    Use the ``psutil`` module if available.

``get_stats()`` function:

    Get statistics on Python memory allocations per Python filename and
    per Python line number.

    Return a dictionary
    ``{filename: str -> {line_number: int -> stats: line_stat}}``
    where *stats* in a ``line_stat`` instance. *filename* and
    *line_number* can be ``None``.

    Return an empty dictionary if the tracemalloc module is disabled.


``get_traces(obj)`` function:

   Get all traces of a Python memory allocations.
   Return a dictionary ``{pointer: int -> trace}`` where *trace*
   is a ``trace`` instance.

   Return an empty dictionary if the ``tracemalloc`` module is disabled.


``start_timer(delay: int, func: callable, args: tuple=(), kwargs: dict={})`` function:

    Start a timer calling ``func(*args, **kwargs)`` every *delay*
    seconds.

    The timer is based on the Python memory allocator, it is not real
    time.  *func* is called after at least *delay* seconds, it is not
    called exactly after *delay* seconds if no Python memory allocation
    occurred.

    If ``start_timer()`` is called twice, previous parameters are
    replaced.  The timer has a resolution of 1 second.

    ``start_timer()`` is used by ``DisplayTop`` and ``TakeSnapshot`` to
    run regulary a task.

``stop_timer()`` function:

    Stop the timer started by ``start_timer()``.


trace class
-----------

``trace`` class:

    This class represents debug information of an allocated memory block.

``size`` attribute:

    Size in bytes of the memory block.

``filename`` attribute:

    Name of the Python script where the memory block was allocated,
    ``None`` if unknown.

``lineno`` attribute:

    Line number where the memory block was allocated, ``None`` if
    unknown.


line_stat class
----------------

``line_stat`` class:

    Statistics on Python memory allocations of a specific line number.

``size`` attribute:

    Total size in bytes of all memory blocks allocated on the line.

``count`` attribute:

    Number of memory blocks allocated on the line.


DisplayTop class
----------------

``DisplayTop(count: int=10, file=sys.stdout)`` class:

    Display the list of the *count* biggest memory allocations into
    *file*.

``display()`` method:

    Display the top once.

``start(delay: int)`` method:

    Start a task using ``tracemalloc`` timer to display the top every
    *delay* seconds.

``stop()`` method:

    Stop the task started by the ``DisplayTop.start()`` method

``color`` attribute:

    If ``True``, ``display()`` uses color. The default value is
    ``file.isatty()``.

``compare_with_previous`` attribute:

    If ``True`` (default value), ``display()`` compares with the
    previous snapshot. If ``False``, compare with the first snapshot.

``filename_parts`` attribute:

    Number of displayed filename parts (int, default: ``3``). Extra
    parts are replaced with ``"..."``.

``group_per_file`` attribute:

    If ``True``, group memory allocations per Python filename. If
    ``False`` (default value), group allocation per Python line number.

``show_average`` attribute:

      If ``True`` (default value), ``display()`` shows the average size
      of allocations.

``show_count`` attribute:

    If ``True`` (default value), ``display()`` shows the number of
    allocations.

``show_size`` attribute:

    If ``True`` (default value), ``display()`` shows the size of

    callable object returning a list of
    ``(title: str, format: str, value: int)``.
    *format* must be ``'size'``. The list must always have the same
    length and the same order to be able to compute differences between
    values.

``stop()`` method:

    Stop the task started by the ``TakeSnapshot.start()`` method.

``take_snapshot()`` method:

    Template (``str``) used to create a filename. The following
    variables can be used in the template:

    * ``$pid``: identifier of the current process
    * ``$timestamp``: current date and time
    * ``$counter``: counter starting at 1 and incremented at each snapshot

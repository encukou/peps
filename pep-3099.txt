Abstract
========

This PEP tries to list all BDFL pronouncements on Python 3000 that
refer to changes that will not happen and new features that will not
be introduced, sorted by topics, along with a short explanation or a
reference to the relevant thread on the python-3000 mailing list.


Core language
=============

* Python will not have programmable syntax.

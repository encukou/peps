Abstract
========

This PEP tries to list all BDFL pronouncements on Python 3000 that
refer to changes that will not happen and new features that will not
be introduced, sorted by topics, along with a short explanation or a
reference to the relevant thread on the python-3000 mailing list.


Core language
=============

* ``lambda`` will not be renamed.

   Thread: "genexp syntax / lambda",
   http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-April/001042.html

* Python will not have programmable syntax.

   Thread: "It's a statement! It's a function! It's BOTH!",
   http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-April/000286.html

* There won't be a syntax for ``zip()``-style parallel iteration.

   Thread: "Parallel iteration syntax",
   http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-March/000210.html

* Strings will stay iterable.

   Thread: "Making strings non-iterable",
   http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-April/000759.html

* There will be no syntax to sort the result of a generator expression
  or list comprehension.  ``sorted()`` covers all use cases.

   Thread: "Adding sorting to generator comprehension",
   http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-April/001295.html

* Python 3000 source code won't use non-ASCII Unicode characters for
  anything except string literals or comments.

   Thread: sets in P3K?
   http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-April/01474.html

* Slices and extended slices won't go away (even if the __getslice__
  and __setslice__ APIs may be replaced) nor will they return views
  for the standard object types.

   Thread: Future of slices
   http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-May/001563.html

* It will not be forbidden to reuse a loop variable inside the loop's
  suite.

   Thread: elimination of scope bleeding of iteration variables
   http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2006-May/064761.html


Builtins
========

* ``hash()`` won't become an attribute since attributes should be cheap
  to compute, which isn't necessarily the case for a hash.

   Thread: "hash as attribute/property",
   http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-April/000362.html


Standard types
==============

* Iterating over a dictionary will continue to yield the keys.

   Thread: "Iterating over a dict",
   http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-April/000283.html


Coding style
============

* The (recommended) maximum line width will remain 80 characters,
  for both C and Python code.

   Thread: "C style guide",
   http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-March/000131.html
